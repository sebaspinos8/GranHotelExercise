                    this file is located at :"/GranHotelExercise/Backend Gran Hotel/appsettings.json", then it is needed open the terminal and write the dotnet 
                    run command, this initializes the project and shows us the url of localhost and its port we will save this for later. Example: "http://localhost:5126"

                    for its operation and it directs us to the web application to be able to use it.
                    
- ### Important Notes: status "A" means available and "N" means not available, when a reservation goes to status A it is not taken into, it is like a logical elimination 

- ### If the client does not exist at check-in, it is created automatically, if it has an ID already created, it is obtained with the name of the check-in database. To check out you only need to press the button since the departure date is the current one
